# PutMeThere
This projec contains the source code for the user study of the paper: "How Far is Too Far? The Trade-Off between Selection Distance and Accuracy during Teleportation in Immersive Virtual Reality" (doi: TODO).

To run the project in unity, simply download the project as a .zip and open in with the unity hub. The project uses Unity version 2022.3.29 and was desgined to be used with a Meta Quest 3 headset, but should also run on any other VR headset supporting Open XR.
Note that all assets were removed due to copyright. In the Build folder there is the .apk file of the project with all assets which was used during the user study, as well as a Windows build of this repository using the XR Device Simulator so it can be used without a VR headset.
