# PutMeThere
This project contains the source code for the user study of the paper: "How Far is Too Far? The Trade-Off between Selection Distance and Accuracy during Teleportation in Immersive Virtual Reality" (doi: TODO).

To run the project in unity, simply download the project as a .zip and open it within the unity hub. The project uses Unity version 2022.3.29 and was desgined to be used with a Meta Quest 3 headset, but should also run on any other VR headset supporting Open XR.


Note that all assets were removed due to copyright.You can downloald the .apk file (which can be installed on a standalone VR headset) that was used during the user study here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15094087. There is also a .zip file containing a Windows build of the project which uses the XR Device Simulator so it can be used without a VR headset.
