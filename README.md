# PutMeThere
This project contains the source code for the user study of the paper: "How Far is Too Far? The Trade-Off between Selection Distance and Accuracy during Teleportation in Immersive Virtual Reality" (doi: TODO).

To run the project in unity, simply clone it and open it within the unity hub. The project uses Unity version 2022.3.29 and was desgined to be used with a Meta Quest 3 headset, but should also run on any other VR headset supporting Open XR.
When you launch the project via the unity editor make sure to start it at the "SettingsScene" in order to properly initialize all parameters. Per default the XR Device Simulator is activated so it runs without a VR headset.

Note that all assets were removed to avoid copyright issues. You can downloald the .apk file (which can be installed on a standalone VR headset) that was used during the user study here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15094087.
